'''main steps
1. add function, inputs root node (no char assigned to it), and the whole word.
2. iterate through the word, character-wise, starting with first char
3. check if current 'node' (points to root at beginning) has a child node with that char
4. check if found increment counter, indicate it has repeated occurence of the char
5. check if not found, add new node as child of current node
6. assign child node as current node, which means next iteration will start from here, before it starts with next character of the word. 
7. mark end of word as finished word True

searching for prefix
1. start with root node and prefix word to search for
2. for each character search through children of current node (start at root with no char), searches by level (bfs?)
3. check if found and point (reassign) current node to child node
4. if not found, return False to indicate prefix doesn't exist.
5. handle case where prefix is bigger than word
