'''
A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

starting at 999 going to 899, backwards
do for loop in for loop to produce multiplication
check result reads the same forwards and backwards
