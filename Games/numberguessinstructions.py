from sys import stdin #to prompt player use std.readline()
from random import randint #use randint(start,stop) to get random number
#don't touch code above; what is it doing?

#Step 1: Intro to the game 
#display a welcoming message
#display a question that asks the player for their name
#use std.readline() to prompt
#store the name in a container 
#display a welcome message, welcoming the player by their name
#write the code below

#Step 2: Create random number, and counting
#ask player to guess the number
#store their guess in a variable
#create variable that will count attempts player made to guess number
#or
#create variable that will decrease if player guesses incorrectly
#write the code below


#Step 3: Comparing cases, creating conditions
#if the guess is equal to the random number then 
	#print some message
	#increase a counting variable by 1 value (or decrease life)
#if the guess is greater than the random number then
	#print some message
	#increase counting variable by 1 value (or decrease life)
	#have person guess again and store their guess
#if the guess is less than the random number then
	#print some message
	#increase counting variable by 1 value (or decrease life)
	#have person guess again and store their guess
#write the code below

#Step 4: repeating the code? 
#It would be inefficient to copy and paste all the if statements above
#create a loop that repeats step 3 however many times you want
#if you make step 3 a function (define it) it will be easier to repeat


#Step 5: Consider playing again?
#display how many attempts were made
#ask user if they want to play again
#if yes, run steps 2 - 4 again
#if no, end the game with game over or some other messagew
